## Tips for Better Results

### Basic Tips
1. **Be Descriptive**: The more detail, the better the output
2. **Mention Style**: "flat design", "3D render", "watercolor", "minimalist"
3. **Specify Colors**: "blue and orange gradient", "monochrome", "pastel colors"
4. **Include Context**: "suitable for dark mode", "web-safe", "mobile app"
5. **Define Purpose**: "for hero section", "app icon", "documentation"
6. **Pick the Aspect Ratio**: use `--aspect 16:9` for banners and headers, `9:16` for phone screens (default 1:1)
7. **No Transparency**: output is JPEG, so there is no transparent background. For icons that need one, remove the background afterwards or draw them as SVG

### Advanced Photography Tips
8. **Specify Camera Settings**: "85mm f/1.4 lens", "50mm prime", "shallow depth of field"
9. **Define Lighting Setup**: "three-point lighting", "soft key light from left", "rim light for separation"
10. **Reference Film Stocks**: "Kodak Portra 400 tones", "Fujifilm Pro 400H", "subtle film grain"
11. **Add Era Aesthetics**: "1990s disposable camera quality", "early-2000s digital look"
12. **Include Texture Details**: "natural skin texture with visible pores", "fabric weave visible"
13. **Specify Framing**: "chest-up framing", "3/4 body shot", "rule of thirds placement"
14. **Preserve Faces**: When editing, add "keep facial features exactly consistent" or "do not alter the face"
